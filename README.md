📘 Project Overview

The Knowledge-Base Search Engine is an intelligent system designed to search across multiple documents (PDF/Text) and provide synthesized answers using LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
It allows users to upload documents and ask questions related to the content — the app then retrieves relevant sections and generates accurate, context-aware responses.

🎯 Objective

To build a smart information retrieval engine that answers user queries based on document context using Gemini LLM and RAG methodology.

⚙️ Scope of Work

Input: Text/PDF documents

Output: User query → synthesized answer using document content

Frontend: For query submission and displaying results
